# Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App Using Convolutional Neural Networks. 
#### * Model Accuracy on Kaggle MNIST Test Dataset - 0.99371.
#### * I have used CNN model to train parameters on about 36,000 training examples from Kaggle MNIST Dataset.
#### * I have used convolutional layers alongwith max-pooling layers.
#### * I also trained a logistic regression model (after dimensionality reduction) but the best accuracy it produced was 0.97700.
#### * Both the models can be found on my github repo.

## How to use(in windows)?
#### * Install python 3.5+, flask, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras using pip install 'package name'.
#### * Open terminal.
#### * Go to the directory where this project's file 'app.py' is located.
#### * Execute command 'python app.py'
#### * This will start server on local port(most probably http://127.0.0.1:8000).
#### * Draw and predict the digits!
